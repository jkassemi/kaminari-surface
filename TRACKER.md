# Version

[x] I should have a basic rails application with kaminari pagination (prototyping)
[x] I should be able to use a functioning prototype of the surfacing pagination (prototyping)
[x] `README.md` should better present the solution
[x] The surfacing pagination should be implemented as a basic ruby gem.

# Backlog

# Icebox

[ ] `README.md` should include a series of examples
[ ] Documentation should detail how to enable explicitly and disable globally.
[ ] I should be able to conceptualize around an ajax pagination feature (prototyping)
[ ] I should be able to use surfacing pagination with ajax (prototyping)
